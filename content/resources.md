| Eclipse KUKSA.ide        |  https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.ide      |  Browser-based IDE used by developers to create applications for the Eclipse Kuksa in-vehicle. If you are searching for an integrated way to build applications based on vehicle data provided by KUKSA.val, you may want to check the [IoTEA project](https://github.com/GENIVI/iot-event-analytics) | 
| KUKSA.Apps               | https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.apps      | Contains applications to showcase use-cases of Eclipse KUKSA. Demos regarding vehicle signal access have been moved over to [KUKSA.val](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val) |
| KUKSA.In-Vehicle         | https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.invehicle | The in-vehicle platform of Eclipse Kuksa. The KUKSA hardware has been moved to [KUKSA.hardware](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.hardware), the VISS dataserver for accessing in-vehicle data is further developed in [KUKSA.val](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val ) | 
| KUKSA.integration        |  https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.integration |Integration tests for Eclipse Kuksa |



# Getting Started
To learn how to use the KUKSA.val VISS server to access standardized vehicle signals check the [KUKSA.val Readme](https://github.com/eclipse/kuksa.val/blob/master/README.md).

For an end-to-end usecase incuding in-vehicle as well as KUKSA.cloud components, check how the [DIAS project](https://dias-project.com/) used [KUKSA for preventing exhaust system tampering](https://dias-kuksa-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
